	<h5> Courses </h5>
    <p> I am teaching the course "Robot Motion Planning and Control" (SC42090) in Q3.
    </p>

	<h5> BSc internships / research assistantships </h5>
	<p> 
	Our department does not offer any such positions for external students.
	</p>
	
	<h5> MSc projects </h5>
<p> 
 Every year we accept several students from the MSc Robotics, the Vehicle Engineering track and the BioRobotics specialization within the MSc Mechanical Engineering. In exceptional cases, we also supervise students from other MSc studies - if you are interested please see below the information that we require from you. Although projects can start anytime, most projects start in the fall and we try to announce them in the spring. We advise interested students to contact us several months before the intended start date.
</p>
<p> 
In the following link you can find a list of available MSc projects.
<br>
Please first contact the daily supervisor to discuss the project.
<br>
<a href="thesis/thesis.html">Available MSc thesis projects</a>
</p>

	<h5> Internships </h5>
<p> 
Several companies working in robotics or transportation offer internships (and sometimes MSc projects) for MSc students. Some companies that you may reach out to are:
<a href="thesis/available/msc_21_2getthere_internshipDescription.pdf">2getthere</a>, 
<a href="industry/Internship Lowpad multi robot planning.pdf">Lowpad</a>,
TNO, 
Vanderlande, 
Siemens (autonomous cars), 
Lely, 
Verity Studios, 
any car manufacturer, Amazon (application is almost one year in advance), Demcon Unmanned Systems, Via, 
Uber, 
Ortec, Connexxion.
You may also find many more companies searching the websites of Robovalley and Yes! Delft.
</p>

<h5> Applications </h5>
<p>
We can occasionally accommodate (additional) highly motivated students in MSc projects or in ongoing projects before their graduation stage.
 <br>
 <br>
If you are interested in working on a project with us, please send us ca. 1 academic quarter before the intended starting date an e-mail including:
 <br>
- a short CV (½ - 1 page) <br>
- BSc & MSc transcripts <br>
- a short motivation letter <br>
- BSc thesis (PDF) <br>
- any other information that might be relevant for the application
 <br>
 <br>
The motivation letter should state: <br>
- what are you interested in? What would you like to achieve?<br>
- the type of assignment you are interested in (more theoretical/more applied)<br>
- whether you prefer a project at the TU or at a company<br>
- the intended starting date<br>
- your relevant experience (studies, technical projects, internships, hobbies, etc.)<br>
- programming languages and related (C, C++, Python, ROS, etc.)
</p>

    <h5> Student project supervision </h5>
    <p> We offer several MSc projects in multi-robot motion planning and control, navigation in dynamic environments and automated mobility-on-demand. We have to give priority to students in the MSc ME tracks VE/BR/  <br>
    Interested students should contact the daily supervisor of the specific project first.
    Available MSc projects are:<br>
    - Distributed multi-task allocation for multi-robot systems<br>
    - Ride-sharing for Automated Mobility-on-Demand [see <a href="docs/17-alonsomora-ridesharing-pnas.pdf">[PDF]</a> and 
<a href="https://youtu.be/xHWrRci0H54">[video]</a> for related work].<br>
	- Multi-robot motion planning for a team of aerial robots in dynamic and uncertain environments. Applications: inspection, monitoring or coverage 
	[see <a href="docs/17-naegeli-RAL.pdf">[PDF]</a> and 
<a href="https://youtu.be/dh7yOEHBc_w">[video]</a> for related work].<br>
	- Distributed trajectory optimization for multiple robots with minimal communication requirements 
	[see <a href="docs/18-ferranti-ECC.pdf">[PDF]</a> and 
<a href="https://youtu.be/draP8lQMxmc">[video]</a> for related work].<br>
	- Data-driven motion planning for self-driving cars in urban environments 
	[see <a href="docs/18-zhou-ICRA.pdf">[PDF]</a> and 
<a href="https://youtu.be/zaD-vCEOU9M">[video]</a> for related work].<br>
	- Localization, mapping and obstacle detection for mobile robots [Requires experience/interest in perception].<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    MSc projects/internships with industry partners:<br>
    - Waternet: Navigation for an autonomous boat in city canals (Amsterdam).<br>
    - Mainblades: Automated inspection with aerial vehicles (Den Haag). <br>
    - Other companies on request.
    </p>

    <p>
    Students interested in a MSc project should contact me and provide the following information:<br>
	- Why are you interested in this project? What would you like to achieve?<br>
	- What is your experience relevant to this project? This could be past projects, past courses; theoretical knowledge or practical experience, related to constrained optimization, planning and/or robotics.<br>
	- When would you like to start and which courses will you have left by then?<br>
	- Is your motivation to do algorithmic work or applied research?<br>
	- Your transcript of record with past courses, including which master & track you are following.<br>
	- Available day/times to meet within one/two weeks.</p>
