	<h5> MSc projects </h5>
<p> 
Every year we accept several students from the Vehicle Engineering track and BioRobotics specialization within the MSc Mechanical Engineering. In exceptional cases, we also supervise students from other MSc studies - if you are interested please see below the information that we require from you.
 <br>
In the following you can find a list of available MSc projects, with starting date. Please first contact the daily supervisor to discuss the project.
<br>
For students interested in a longer research experience (e.g. if you would like to publish an article during your MSc thesis or do a PhD afterwards), all of our MSc Thesis and Literature Survey assignments can be extended with a Research Assignment in the same topic. We do not offer separate Research Assignments - only those linked to an MSc thesis project.
</p>

<!----     INSTRUCTIONS      ------>
<!----
FOR NEW PROJECTS:
Copy the text below, paste it at the TOP and fill it in with the information of your project.
PLEASE LEAVE A SEPARATION BETWEEN PROJECTS!
Put yourself as the daily supervisor, with email address.
Make sure that the link to the pdf works and the pdf is in the same folder.
Only use the external collaborators field if there are any.

IF YOUR PROJECT IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE:
- IF IT IS TAKEN:
--- MOVE IT TO PAST PROJECTS (thesis_past)
--- MOVE THE PDF DESCTIPTION INSIDE OLD/
--- ADD THE NAME OF THE STUDENT AND STARTING DATE!
- ELSE: Delete it.
